# SnakeAIProject

Instructions on how to train your on SnakeAI:
- Creation of a virtual env using Anaconda Navigator, Python 3.8.
- The virutal env must contain both PYGAME and PYTORCH installed.
- Activate the virtual env before running the program in the terminal or IDE.
- Download all of the files and put them ALL IN THE SAME FOLDER.
- Run agent.py

Pygame serves as the foundation for the game's graphical interface, offering a dynamic and interactive environment for our neural network to navigate. Meanwhile, PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library, provides the tools necessary to train and implement the neural network model. My goal is to witness the Snake AI evolve and learn from its experiences, gradually becoming more adept at navigating the game board and achieving higher scores. 

OBS:
- A new file/archives are going to be created, do not delete them, they are the collected data used to save the best snake models.
- It wil take around 80 to 100 games for you snake to start behaving properly.
