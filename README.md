# SnakeAIProject

Welcome to our exciting venture into the world of artificial intelligence and gaming! In this project, we have developed a neural network specifically tailored to play the classic Snake game using Pygame and PyTorch. This innovative undertaking merges the fun of gaming with the complexity of machine learning to create a smart and adaptive Snake player.

Pygame serves as the foundation for the game's graphical interface, offering a dynamic and interactive environment for our neural network to navigate. Meanwhile, PyTorch, a powerful deep learning library, provides the tools necessary to train and implement the neural network model.

Our goal is to witness the Snake AI evolve and learn from its experiences, gradually becoming more adept at navigating the game board and achieving higher scores. Throughout the project, we'll explore the intricacies of training a neural network, fine-tuning its parameters, and observing how it adapts to various game scenarios.

Whether you're a gaming enthusiast, a machine learning aficionado, or someone curious about the intersection of these two realms, join us on this journey as we unravel the mysteries of Snake AI development using Pygame and PyTorch. Let the games begin!
